# Brief
This section is not a law code, it just describes the license in a
human-friendly way.

Both licenses are slight modifications of the MIT/X11 license. This is a
permissive license, you can do anything with code, but you just have to leave
copyright notices untouched. Beside, we give you absolutely no guarantees.

Tinyboard and vichan licenses also clarify, that the copyright notices found
in the template footers are also covered by the copyright notice preservation
clause.
