H0K4CH4N - A PHP imageboard forked from Vichan and Tinyboard .
========================================================

Introduction
------------

Dev 6 is coming along nicely. APC caching has been added again... well more like apcu caching and it works with php 7.0. the post form looks like 8chan. I fixed some code errors for 7.0 and possibly 7.1. 
The minify library got updated. More useless folders and files have been removed. the captcha iplementation works pretty good. lazy load makes it so that the site loading goes a lot smoother there are still some ajax issues but those can be fixed in the future.

About
------------
H0K4CH4N is a free light-weight, fast, highly configurable and user-friendly
imageboard software package. It is written in PHP and has few dependencies.

H0K4CH4Nn is a fork of [Vichan](https://engine.vichan.net/) and (now defunc'd) 
[Tinyboard](http://github.com/savetheinternet/Tinyboard),

H0K4CH4N tries to combine useful features of Infinity, Vichan and TinyBoard.
While removing useless/outdated/unfinished/broken code.

Requirements
------------
1.	PHP = 7.0 (PHP 7.0 is recommended and you should use this one if you want the get the least conflicts. 5.6 should work also but might not work when we improve it for 7.0)
2.	MySQL/MariaDB server
3.	[mbstring](http://www.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php) 
4.	[PHP GD](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.image.php)
5.	[PHP PDO](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php)

We try to make sure H0K4CH4N is compatible with all major web servers and
operating systems. <strike>Vichan does not include an Apache ```.htaccess``` file nor does
it need one.</strike>  H0K4CH4N will require one and will include an example soon.

### Recommended
1.	MySQL/MariaDB server >= 5.5.3
2.	ImageMagick (command-line ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick preferred).

### H0K4CH4N/Tinyboard/Vichan support

links may be helpful for you as well: 

*	Tinyboard documentation can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20121016074303/http://tinyboard.org/docs/?p=Main_Page).
*	Vichan help can be found [here](http://int.vichan.net/devel/).

CLI tools
-----------------
There are a few command line interface tools, based on Tinyboard-Tools. These need
to be launched from a Unix shell account (SSH, or something). They are located in a ```tools/```
directory.

You actually don't need these tools for your imageboard functioning, they are aimed
at the power users.
